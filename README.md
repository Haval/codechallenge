Roadmap
-------

    * [ ] Specify challenge name, duration, rules
    * [ ] Other things to specify?
    * [ ] Challenge owners can modify their own challenges
    * [ ] Challenge owners can assign judges (non-participants)

* [ ] Participating in challenges:
    * [ ] Reputation-based challenges?
    * [ ] Time-based challenges (months, days, hours?)
    * [ ] Collaborative challenges

* [ ] Reputation-based system (a la Stack Exchange) that gives users graduated capabilities:
	* [ ] Vote for challenges
	* [ ] Create challenges
